    "## Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial brute force approach would be to iterate across all possible trees, which would mean creating/navigating each possible tree path. This is very expensive in terms of run time. You can try a left side of 0 items and stick all the rest to the right side. You can try a left side with just 1 item and stick the rest to the right. Thus we can think of all the combinations as:\n",
    "* 0 to the left, n - 1 to the right\n",
    "* 1 to the left, n - 2 to the right\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* n - 1 to the left, 0 to the right\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to do this for each depth of the tree, and the depth of the tree can be up to n deep, meaning the worst case runtime would be O(n^n).\n",
    "\n",
    "One key thing to note here is that for a BST, all things assigned to the left must be lower and all things assigned to the right must be higher. Because of this, we can just think of all the numbers as a bunch of blocks numbered 1 to n and we simply have to pick a block to be the divider (parent node) and all the blocks on the left go to the left side of the BST and all the blocks on the right go to the right side of the BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we reduce something that is exponential in nature? We can take this as a hint to use [Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/) to make things linear in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive sub problem that we can memoize is running `numTrees` on a smaller `n` value. The base case would be when `n` is either 1 or 0, in which case, there is only 1 possible resulting tree structure."
