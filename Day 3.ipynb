    "\n",
    "For this question, a brute force solution would involve two nested loops. For each index in the array, you would see what's the minimum numbers of subsequent items you need to add in order to be greater than or equal to `k`. So this brute force solution has a runtime complexity of `O(n^2)` with `n = the number of elements in the input list`."

    "## Better solution\n",
    "Given that we have an initial brute force solution of `O(n^2)`, some possible improvements include reducing the complexity to `O(n*logn)` and `O(n)` runtime. Note, some of these improvements will be a tradeoff with space complexity and the idea behind this is to store some of the calculations as you go in some kind of data structure. This is the whole idea of an \"algorithms and data structure\" programming interview after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does an `O(n*logn)` solution look like? Well upon initial thinking, that's probably not a valid approach because we want to keep the initial structure of the array. This is because you want to find the subarray, which means the order of the initial array should not be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so what does an `O(n)` solution look like? Well for these kinds of solutions, it means that we can only scan the input list `X` number of times where `X` is some defined number. We call this number a \"constant\" because it's a pre-determined number and not dependent on the input. It could be 2, 3, 6, etc. So how can we find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than or equal to `k`?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely on a sliding window approach. You can think of it as having two pointers, one pointing to the left side of the window, and one pointing to the right side of the window. Our key insight is to rely on the fact that when the  right pointer moves by one, we are _adding_ to the subarray sum for that window and when the left pointer moves by one, we are _subtracting_ from the subarray sum for that window. Understanding this, when the sum of the window is `>= k`, we can move the left pointer and when the sum of the window is `< k`, we can move the right pointer."

    "* expire data after a certain period of time (`Y` minutes)\n",

    "* support and enforce a certain size limit - how to handle when cache is full (what kind of eviction policy)?\n",
    "* support concurrency - how do we want to lock and ensure thread safety?\n",
